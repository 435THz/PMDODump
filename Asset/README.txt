[TROUBLESHOOTING - for if the game fails to work]
If you're on Windows, and the game is unable to load certain DLLs, you may need to install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86).
This most commonly occurs on newly installed computers.  You can find an installer at:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685

If you're on Mac, and encounter an error where it is unable to load DLL "libgdiplus", then you may need to install GDI+ using brew:
brew install mono-libgdiplus

If the game worked for you before but suddenly it won't start up, it is likely that the extraction directories are corrupted.  Please delete the specified files:
Windows: %TEMP%\.net
Unix:
  ${TMPDIR}/.net/${UID} if ${TMPDIR} is set; otherwise,
  /var/tmp/.net/${UID} if /var/tmp exists, and is writable; otherwise,
  /tmp/.net/${UID} if /tmp exists, and is writable; otherwise fail.



[PLAYER TIPS - for if you want to win]
-When you go up a floor, there is no turning back.
-You will only gain EXP from defeating a Pokémon if you used a move on it.
-Recruit Pokémon by throwing Apricorns. Weakening the target can increase your chances of success, but statusing it WILL NOT.
-Wild Pokémon always start with 1/2 of their max PP and 50% fullness.
-There is ALWAYS a Plain Apricorn somewhere on the first floor.
-All Pokémon types, abilities, and movesets are up to date in accordance with Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
-The statistics and effects of moves, items, abilities, and status conditions are tweaked can can be SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT from how they are in main series Pokémon titles, and even Pokémon Mystery Dungeon titles.
-You can never miss twice in a row.  Thus if you miss an attack, you can be certain that the next one will hit.  The only exceptions are moves, abilities, etc. that allow 100% avoidance.
-Sticky items cannot be USED.  However, they can be HELD and still continue to give their held-item effects. You can't take off a sticky item if you've held it.
-Any wild Pokémon that faints will drop its item.
-Press Alt in text input to change the accent of the last letter you typed (ex. "e" becomes "é")
-Many traps (including Wonder Tiles) affect all tiles adjacent to them.  Keep this in mind when positioning.
-Pokémon that evolve by friendship need to be surrounded by a full team.
-Pokémon that evolve by location need to be in the correct environment.
-If you throw held items at an enemy, they will catch it if they aren't holding one already.

# 0.8.1 Changes #

* Boss tiles give you an ominous warning before activation
* Recruit rates are all now a multiple of 10%
* Fixed an issue causing missions to generate during rescue missions
* Fixed Sparkly Swirl, which is technically released but unobtainable.  The only reason to do this was so that if metronome rolled it there wouldn't be an error.
* Dev: Removed conversion code from old mods to the current version.

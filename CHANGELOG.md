# 0.8.1 Changes #

* Boss tiles give you an ominous warning before activation
* Recruit rates are all now a multiple of 10%
* Fixed an issue causing missions to generate during rescue missions
* Fixed Sparkly Swirl, which is technically released but unobtainable.  The only reason to do this was so that if metronome rolled it there wouldn't be an error.
* Trip Trap and similar effects will not cause items to be destroyed if they hit a border wall
* Items can be sorted when multiselecting
* Fixed AI misjudging Wide Lens effect
* Fixed indefinite articles in Korean msg logs when picking up stackable items
* Fixed various menu sizing bugs
* Fixed a draw order issue with decorations in ground maps
* Dev: Removed conversion code from old mods to the current version.
* Dev: Fixed annoying loose textures being deleted from misclicking in Map/Ground Editor's default Texture tab
* Dev: This version removes a lot of compatibility conversions from previous versions.  If you still need to convert, downgrade to v0.8 and run reserialization.
